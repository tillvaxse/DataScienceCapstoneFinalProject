# DataScienceCapstoneFinalProject  
The goal of this task is to write a report that can be used as the basis for a final product or perhaps a submission to the Yelp dataset challenge. 
In addition, you need to create a 5-slide deck using RStudio Presenter tools to describe and promote your analysis. 

##Report

Write a 5-page report using R Markdown that describes your question/problem, how you used the dataset, the analysis you conducted, and 
the conclusions that you drew from the analysis. Your report must have the following sections clearly labelled:  

###Title - 

A brief description of what you've done  

###Introduction - 

A description of the question/problem and the rationale for studying it  

###Methods and Data - 

Describe how you used the data and the type of analytic methods that you used; it's okay to be a bit technical here but clarity is important

###Results - 

Describe what you found through your analysis of the data.

###Discussion - Explain how you interpret the results of your analysis and what the implications are for your question/problem.


The final report must be in PDF format using standard page sizes. Please be considerate with respect to using readable font sizes and page margins.

##Slide Deck

Write 5 slides using RStudio Presenter that summarizes your report for a general audience. 
Explain what the problem you presented is interesting and how your analysis directly addresses that problem. 
The slide deck should be published as a viewable HTML presentation hosted on R Pubs or GitHub and you should be able to provide 
a link to the presentation so that others can view it.
